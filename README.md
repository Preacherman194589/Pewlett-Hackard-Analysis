# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett Hackard wants to present a retirement package to its employees, but before they offer it, they asked their HR Analysis in Data Research, Bobby, to look at those who will be retiring in two years and how many will be retiring to help hie more employees. PH wants to prepare for the large number of employees retiring and be able to recruit to replace them. PH believes that Bobby’s research would be able to help the company in the future.

## Results
Based on the information and Data I received, I used PostgreSQL and the pgAdmin system to create the database I needed to conduct the work. I was given six tables or data to work with, and I created additional tables/data to receive the following numbers I needed to present to PH. 
After conducting two analysis deliverables based on the following data, I concluded with four major points. 

1. **Retirement Titles** – Based on first and last name, I developed a list of retires that will be retiring soon and their title and the date of their retirement.

2. **Unique Titles**- The data allowed us to gauge the number of retiring employees, their positions, and areas we need to fill.

3.	**Retiring Titles** – This is much-needed data to allow the company to see which position will be hit the hardest once employees start retiring and the need to fill those positions in the future.

4.	**Mentorship eligibility** – This data allows the company's administration to see the list of qualified employees that could train future employees and allows the company to see and acknowledge those who are employees and their experience to help with mentorship.
